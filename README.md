# Turism and Events in South Tyrol

<img src="./IMG/app_1.png">

## Overview

In this project, we aimed to integrate data from various sources related to events, accommodations, and park places in South Tyrol. We obtained the data from the South Tyrol Open Data Hub via a public API, cleaned and processed it, and populated a database with it. We then used Ontop and tools such as Protégé to create an ontology and mappings that represents the domain of interest and connected the ontology to the data in the database. We also deployed a SPARQL endpoint and ran queries. The final outcome of the project is a Streamlit web application that is able to query the VKG and display the results using visualizations.
